VGeneric for distilled high proof spirit-based aperitif bitters flavored with anise & other herbs - containing wormwood. Used mainly in simple cocktails showcasing it, many more cocktails citing it were actually formulated for the use of absinthe substitutes like Herbsaint or post-1913 Pernod. \u000a\u000aAbsinthe  bans were enacted in many countries in the 1912-1915 period due, in part, to the allegedly deleterious effects of the thujone-laden wormword, and in part to the indigence, and crime associated with the burgeoning consumption of alcohol as a result of the move from agrarian to industrial society and the urban blight associated therewith. \u000a\u000aAbsinthe enjoyed a (continuing) rebirth of popularity in the late 1990s largely founded upon its mythical taboo status. Many new brands of widely varying qualities and quality have appeared based on tenuous historical pretexts.\u000a

VProprietary French bitter-sweet spirit-based aperitif beverage bitters with slight orange character. Notable in the Basque drink, Picon Punch, which is considered one of the finest examples of a highball beverage. Unfortunately, from the 1970s to present, the House of Picon has lowered the proof of their product repeatedly, creating a situation where traditional recipes calling for it (such as the Picon Punch which was created with the original 78 proof product in mind) did not taste the same. Picon's current iteration has an alcohol content of less than half of the original product.\u000a

VDefunct French aperitif, produced by the Hémard company until circa 1928, the name of which means "Passing Fancy". Opinions vary on the nature of this product some suggesting a pastis or absinthe aperitif spirit or liqueur; others defining it as an almond-flavored liqueur similar to Amaretto; and still others merely noting its purported violet color. Hémard went into partnership with Veil Picard after the absinthe ban in 1915 and later merged with acquired Pernod. It seems in reality this was an anis-flavored wine aperitif, and that the "violet color" is a misattribution meant for Parfait Amour. Likewise, the similarity of the names Amaretto and amourette probably explain that story.\u000a

Though containing alcohol up to 80 proof, manufacture was allowed without restriction even during Prohibition, because the bitterness was such that the Internal Revenue Service, who administered compliance with the National Prohibition Act, termed it "non-potable alcohol" ie, too bitter to consume straight.\u000a

VGeneric for French apple brandy with an Armagnac character and highly regulated production/aging methods from the Calvados/Normandy region. Calvados is invariably aged in limousin oak casks, but is surprisingly excellent directly from still to bottle. It is the most respected apple brandy in the world, much as Cognac and Armagnac are the pinnacles of the grape brandy form. Like Cognac, Calvados is normally consumed from a snifter, but nothing short of excellent in cocktails.\u000a

How this might relate to the flavorless, red, wadded-up thing stuffed in some cocktail olives, we would be hard-put to explain.\u000a

Beware, the final incarnation of this liqueur which was produced was with an entirely different base, flavor, and formula. The difference between the two types can be told by the type of bottle the liqueur appears in. The original version was in an orb of the type Chambord appears in today, the latter version, in a generic Jacquin bottle. The former had a light pleasant honey/citrus character, the latter is more reminiscent of pancake syrup.

The only reference to this product with this spelling was in a drink named the Cubano. Its first appearance was in the Savoy Cocktail Book (London 1930). In 1934, "Cocktail Bill" Boothby listed the recipe in his guide with the ingredient entirely eliminated, as did Trader Vic in 1947. Ever since, (as here,) "Charbreux" only shows up in recipe lists which draw from the Savoy book - or from the books which drew from those books!\u000a

Originally herbal (for preservation reasons) now liqueurs are flavored with no end of things from fruits, nuts, berries, seeds, herbs & grasses, barks, vegetables, spices, and the spirits themselves. In some old texts, "cordial" refers either to preparations in which flavoring was added by infusion (cold soaking) instead of maceration (hot soaking) or to preparations to which flavoring was added by infusion AND maceration - but not distillation. Still others suggest cordials are nonalcoholic while liqueurs contain alcohol. In truth, the terms are now virtually synonymous.\u000a

VProprietary French sweetened anis-flavored absinthe substitute named for the company that once produced the most popular absinthe before the French banned it in 1915.

VGeneric for rum-based spicy pimiento berry-flavored liqueur of the Caribbean. The pimento or pimiento is the berry from which the spice allspice is derived. English explorers coined the term allspice because the berry seemed to encapsulate the flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove all at once. How this might relate to the flavorless, red, wadded-up thing stuffed in some cocktail olives, we would be hard-put to explain. The only currently produced brand appears to be Wray & Nephew Pimento Liqueur. Unfortunately, importation and marketing of this product ceased in the United States in the 1980s. Highly recommended.\u000a

VGeneric for a very sweet-yet-piquant clear Italian liqueur flavored with anise, licorice root and an infusion with elderberry in a neutral spirit base. Sambucca is similar to Anisette but with a higher alcohol content. The term Sambuca usually refers to the transparent version, although other versions exist such as black sambuca. The liqueur is prepared by the steam distillation of star aniseeds. The resulting fragrant essential oil is infused with neutral spirits, witch elder berries and licorice.  Other natural flavors and sweetening are added. The origin of the name Sambuca is believed to be Arabian, likely an Italian version of Zammut, - the anise-based drink that first came to the Italian harbors on ships coming from the Far East centuries ago. Residents of Civitavecchia, a port city near Rome, already produced the anise-based liqueur and perhaps renamed it "Sambuca" for trading convenience;  Civitavecchians still produce it in large quantities today. While popular in mixed drinks, the common and traditional manner of comsumption is straight, with coffee beans -- two or more depending on the locale. There are a number of respected sambuca brands on the Italian market. These include Sambuca Borghetti and Sambuca Ramazzotti.  With 87% global market share, Sambuca Molinari is the overall market leader, though Sambuca Romano is the most popular in the United States.\u000a

VNeutral spirit, diluted and filtered through charcoal. Dependent on the nature of the distillate, the temperature & number of distillations, the nature of the diluting water, and the number of filtrations for any particular brand's given character. Vodka can be made from many bases: grain, potato, beet, cane, or rice. "Vodka" is diminutive for "voda," the word for water in Russian. Vodka was traditionally unflavored (other than the flavor of the alcohol itself) and infusions of flavoring ingredients garnered the spirit a different name, depending upon the ingredient(s) added. In current-day parlance, flavored renditions are all considered subsets of vodka, so-named. Vodka was historically traditional mainly to Russia, Poland, and Latvia.\u000a

VGeneric for vodka which, after distillation, is flavored with natural or artificial herbal, spice, or fruit components by infusion, maceration, aging, or secondary distillations. Historically, infused vodkas each took on their own names, and once flavored, were not, strictly speaking, vodka any longer. In current-day parlance, flavored renditions are all considered subsets of vodka, so-named. Traditionally, vodkas were flavored with herbs, grasses, spices, and occasionally sweetened with honey. The modern trend is to treat vodkas with simple fruit flavors, a process made easier by 20th-21st century technolgies of chemistry and preservation. Even given that, the quality of fruit flavors in vodka varies widely with few attaining characters which can truly be termed "natural".\u000a

VProprietary for an infused vodka spirit containing a blade and the flavor, either real or artificial, of bison grass. Formerly a generic spirit like vodka itself, the name rights to zubrowka are now in the hands of one company which had long produced one of the more acclaimed brands of it. Because the bison grass in traditional zubrowka contains coumarin, (an anticoagulant) it was made illegal to import it into the U.S. in 1978. In the late 1990s, one brand with artificial flavoring was produced to fill the void in the face of increasing interest in the spirit. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, which administers American alcohol laws, recently relaxed these restrictions somewhat and the classic brand of zubrowka, Polmos Bialystok, responded with a modified strain of bison grass with lower coumarin levels for the American market. The flavor is virtually indistiguishable from the original, though the color (pale yellow green) is a bit overly-pronounced suggesting some artificial manipulation of the hue.\u000a

All of this enhances the potential for fermentation (ie hard apple cider) in a manner not present in the juice. Note that differences between what is "apple juice" and what is "apple cider" varies widely by brand, and sometimes there is NO difference. An excellent cocktail/mixed drink/punch additive, more prevalent in years-past than now. The meaning of cider in the United Kingdom is different, referring to a fermented apple beverage, drunk like (and with a similar proof to) beer. See also cider & apple juice.\u000a

Capillaire syrup was mainly seen in European drink recipes, but found its way into early 19th century compounders' guides in the U.S. as well, where it largely came to mean any simple syrup flavored with orange flower water or other orange (and occasionally lemon) flavoring. Below is a formula for its preparation:\u000a\u000aBoil for 5 minutes: 1 qt. of water with two handsful of capillaire (dried maidenhair fern leaves). Cover, remove from heat and allow to infuse for 1 hour. Filter. Add 2-1/4 lbs of sugar and boil again for 10 minutes, then skim any foam off the syrup. Add 3 tsp of orange flower water and bottle.\u000a

VGeneric for the bottled fermented juice of apples. The United States is the only country to call unfemented apple juice cider. In other countries, notably England and the British Isles, cider is what Americans call "hard" cider, meaning apple juice that has been fermented with yeast to produce an alcoholic component. It is consumed there in the same manner as, and similar proof to beer. In the U.K., hard cider is sometimes mixed, about 50/50, with amber ale to make a drink known as The Snake Bite, and the British are also known to add Pernod to their hard cider, ordered as Pernod and cider. Hard cider, of the British and European style, while uncommon, IS also produced in the U.S.A. The term "cider," used alone, refers to this alcoholic version. See "apple cider" and "apple juice" for the traditional American versions.\u000a

VGeneric for a flavored sugar syrup, non-or-lightly alcoholic (5 to 11%), used almost exclusively in rum-based tropical drinks. Thick, transluscent and straw-colored, it has a subtle sweet/tart/spicy character. There is some question as to when it was created - some sources suggesting as long ago as the 1700s, others pinpointing it in the 1890s or 1930s. \u000a\u000aTwo companies have asserted themselves to be successors to the inventor of falernum. Velvet Falernum, produced by R.L. Seale, Ltd. said to have been invented by John D. Taylor in 1890, and Stansfeld-Scott, Inc., successors to A.V. Stansfeld in said to have been invented by A.V. Stansfeld in 1935. A Bajan brand, Stansfeld Falernum is no longer produced. No independent corroboration has yet been established for either claim. The Velvet Falernum bottle shows a depiction of a gold medal said to have been won in 1923 at a Bajan agricultural exhibition. There too, the depiction is generic and no specific information has been presented regarding the exhibition. Even its general citation is vague. That said, the 45 year earlier claim is persuasive.\u000a\u000aOur research has turned up no written reference previous to the 1930s. While the product may be proprietary insofar as ownership of the Falernum name in certain geographic regions is concerned, multiple companies produce it in its native Barbados, Bermuda, and in the United States. Examples are John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum (Barbados,) Hanschell Innis Falernum (Barbados,) Gosling's Falernum (Bermuda,) Da Vinci Caribbean Falernum (United States,) and Fee Brothers West Indies Style Falernum (United States.)\u000a

VGeneric for high-concentration water & sugar solution, either prepared at home or available commercially. See also cane syrup, rock candy syrup, gomme syrup, capillaire syrup and syrup.\u000a\u000aHome made simple syrup can be produced with varying sweetness levels based on proportions from the very sweet 3 parts sugar to 1 part water to the very simple formula of equal parts of each. Drink recipes may require adjustment based on the proportions chosen, but below are instructions for making the latter which suits drinks seen in CocktailDB:\u000a\u000aFill a bottle halfway with granulated sugar and halfway with filtered water. Cap the bottle and shake it vigorously for several seconds. Set it down for several minutes to allow it to settle, then shake it some more. In time, all of the sugar will have dissolved in the\u000awater creating a 1:1 simple syrup. As indicated above, proportions may be adjusted to make stronger, thicker syrup, though the more sugar used, the longer dissolution will take. Using "superfine" granulated sugar (*not confectioners or powdered sugar*) speeds dilution.\u000a\u000aThe entire process may be accelerated by stirring the sugar and water (at whatever proportional balance is chosen) at a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Care should be taken to regulate the heat as anything over a simmer may create a frothy scum that requires removal.\u000a\u000aFinally, it can be useful to stir in a small quantity of neutral grain spirits (or vodka) as a preservative if long storage is planned.\u000a

VGeneric refined crystalline product of sugar cane which is the sweetening of choice in the majority of mixed drinks. Sugar has come in many forms and have been applied to drinks accordingly: Bar sugar is a far more finely-ground white processed sugar, more like a powder than table sugar. Sugar cubes are simply highly-compressed cubes of table sugar. Loaf sugar is the less-dense historic precursor to bulk sugar, coming in large & small cones weighing from 25 to 60 lbs., chunks being broken or shaved off as needed. Sugar lumps or chunks are merely irregularly-shaped nuggets of sugar, about the size and density of sugar cubes. Sugar is used as a garnish (as on a sugared glass rim) as well as a sweetener.\u000a

VGeneric for sweetened quinine-imbued carbonated (sparkling) water, first produced commercially in 1858. Indian Tonic, as it was first called(and still is in Europe and the U.K.)is thought to have originated with the British Raj in colonial India as a ministration for fevers, most notably Malaria. Its popular use in American mixed drinks began with its first production in 1953 on U.S. soil under a Schweppes (Cadbury-Schweppes as of 1969) brand franchise. Unfortunately because quinine is a drug, American tonic water, under the edicts of the Food & Drug Administration contains less of it and is notably sweeter and milder than its European counterparts - which are much preferable.\u000a

VDefunct or all-but defunct generic term for dark rums produced in New England, generally under the descriptive name "Medford" rum, from colonial times to Prohibition. Medford is a Massachusetts town where, or in close proximity to where, many of the rum distilleries and warehouses were located. The cold and clammy conditions there made for rums with similar character to London dock and navy rums. They were highly acclaimed. Abolition of the  slave trade (and the slaves-sugarcane/molassas-rum triangle) crippled Medford rum's production, and Prohibition essentially killed it. In latter years, there was a branded rum named Medford, but the term itself was a generic one previous to that, and remains so today.\u000a

VGeneric for single-malt whiskey distilled from predominately rye mash combined with a lesser quantity of corn mash. Mainly refers to American whiskey, but is also a term used by Canadian distillers (in which case, unless specifically noted otherwise, really denotes a blended whiskey). In the main, rye is quite like Bourbon but, with a few exceptions, is drier (not as sweet) tasting. Historically, rye was produced mostly in Pennsylvania and aged in warehouses along the Monongahela River, though currently it is made along side the more popular Bourbon in the places Bourbon is produced.\u000a"Straight rye whiskey" in the United States means whiskey produced from a mash of at least 51% rye grains, distilled below 160 proof, aged at least two years in new, charred oak barrels, and diluted with nothing other than water.\u000a

VGeneric for whisky made in Scotland in one of three styles: either blended, single-malt, or vatted. Scotch is made by malting grain (allowing it to germinate) and then roasting it on a grate under which burning peat moss produces thick pungent smoke - which gives Scotch its smoky flavor - and the ferments distilled. The distillate is then casked for aging, and is (with water dilution) either bottled - or neutral spirits are added to it (for a blended Scotch) and it is then bottled. Most cocktails call for blended Scotch.\u000a

VUse of raw egg in beverages long predates the creations of cocktails & related drink forms themselves, and was a valued ingredient from their onset. Usually used for the emulsifying consistency and foaminess it imparts, it is often subdivided into its yolk & white parts as separate cocktail constituents, the egg white being the more common ingredient. In classic cocktail terminology, "golden" appended to the name of a cocktail (as in "Golden Bronx") often indicates the additional presence of egg yolk; "silver" (as in "Silver Bronx") requests the additional presence of egg white in recipes otherwise without egg. When either "half a yolk" or "half an egg white" are specified, simply prepare two portions (2 drinks) instead of one - since division of single yolks or whites is problematic. Insofar as egg whites in particular were mainly used as frothing agents, artificial eggless frothing agents have also been developed, though they are not recommended.\u000a

VGeneric for, generally 90% (180 proof) pure ethyl alcohol. The other 10% is distilled water. The only more potent alcohol is known as 'absolute alcohol', which is 99% pure alcohol. Molecular instability precludes the chemical, alcohol, from ever being 100% pure. Grain alcohol is rarely used in cocktails of any quality, though it has been used in some bottled or machine-dispensed mixed drinks - mainly in tropical or quazi-tropical tourist areas. It is remembered with some chagrin, in certain quarters, as the classic component of 'garbage can punch', but its main use, of cocktail interest, is as the spirit base of some liqueurs and the secondary spirit base of blended whiskies. Grain alcohol differs from vodka mainly in the charcoal filtration the latter receives, and the dilution.\u000a

VGeneric for Mexican spirit produced in western Jalisco from agave cactus. Traditionally, raicilla was the name given to illegally-distilled Mescal "moonshine." Like moonshine, quality varies, but the best of the product is smooth, high proof, and in raicilla's case so smoky that it can be said with minimum hyperbole that it makes Laphroig Scotch taste like tap water by comparison. The market for raicilla proved so popular, a legal version is now produced. This is, perhaps, ironic in that the name itself (meaning "root") was coined to escape ready detection by the authorities. Though the product is mainly consumed alone, it is also combine with juices and sodas. Its use in cocktails is, as yet, unheard-of.\u000a

VGeneric for historically somewhat delicately sweet German wine the name of which is a contraction and transliteration for "Hochheimer" meaning from Hochheim, the town around which hock wine was traditionally made. It is considered a variety of Rhine wine, as is bottled in long-necked bottles with gracefully-sloping shoulders. While there are exceptions, it is almost always a white wine. As the popularity of this wine variety grew, other geographic regions also used the term for their similarly-styled wines. Today the name is infrequently used and is virtually synonymous with "Rhine" or "Riesling" as a term for wine without further pedigree from the Rhine region.\u000a

VProprietary brand of U.S. single-malt whiskey akin to Bourbon, but distilled in Tennessee, taking the name of "Tennessee Whiskey." The main difference between George Dickel and Bourbon is the charcoal filtration that Dickel (and all Tennessee whiskey) receives but Bourbon does not. Produced in various age-grades. When Dickel is called for without further description, the 90 proof cream-labeled #12 is generally meant. Note: American whiskey is generally spelled with an "e". George Dickel, chose long ago to spell his like Scotch whisky does, sans "e". Dickel's company produced whiskey in Tennessee until it became a "dry" state in 1910, and in Kentucky until Prohibition (at the Stitzel distillery #17.) After Prohibition, Stitzel-Weller continued the brand as a Bourbon. Schenley bought name rights from Dickel's successors in the early 1950s and in 1958 began the process of moving the operation back to Tennessee to compete with the hugely successful Jack Daniels. Schenley is now owned by Diageo, and George Dickel #12 is the highest proof Tennessee whiskey made today.\u000a

VProprietary for the most popular of German (Prussian) neutral spirit-based liqueurs, sweetened and potently flavored with honey. Compounded, it is said, since the late 15th century. The word translates as "bear hunter" and "baren" (bear) is always used as a prefix for German honey-flavored liqueurs. "Jager" says something of the age and folk origins of this spirit.
